My profound interest in Library Science was built during undergraduate, when I majored in engineering in information security. The training from mathematics and engineering helped me develop my problem-solving skills. I also advanced my ability to retrieve informatin and think logically through my experience as leader of the debate team. However, I always feel a lack of humanistically care, which makes me feel empty and depressed. When the Covid-19 epidemic broke out at winter, I was a sophomore at Wuhan University. When I just left school after the final exam, the city was locked down. In the semester of online classes, I heard from the news that medical staff and ordinary people worked so hard to live, and so many people left forever. I can’s stop thinking if I have ever met them on the streets. All of these struck me deeply. I thought a lot about the fragility of life, the meaning of life, my connection to others, and what I loved, what I wanted to do in my whole life. I want to do something that is relevant to people, something that can change the lives of others. After taking several electives in literature, philosophy, religious science and other social science, I chose library science as major of master.

No matter in providing accurate information about the Covid-19 virus, or in presercing the collective memory of the devastating epidemic, libraries in China didn’t seem to fulfill their responsibility and social function. But why? I wonder the reason and progress behind.
