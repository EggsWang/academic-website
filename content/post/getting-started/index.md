## Overview

While watching the movie Oral History of National Library of China, I was deeply touched by a plot. During the Cultural Revolution, many social institutions were closed down, including most libraries. One day, a librarian who was working in the National Library was told to meet a friend outside. However, when he walked out of the building, he saw a stranger who was, obviously, a minority people. Do you want a Buddhist scripture in Mongolian? He asked, using a mix of Mandarin and dialect, which sounded strange. The librarian went back to ask his director and received a yes. Several weeks later, two librarians traveled to a distant province to obtain the precious Buddhist scripture, which is one of the earliest and most complete religious scriptures in Mongolian. As they were hurrying to the railway station with their luggage containing the scripture, they heard a broadcast about criticizing all past thoughts. One librarian said, "It's paradoxical. When everyone is rushing forward, we are carrying an old book, hoping it can be preserved in this era."

I was noved to tears by the belief and courage of the Mongolian librarian, who knew that the valuable scripture would be destroyed in a remote province. The determination sustained him during the long way to Beijing. He lied and pretended to be a close friend of a librarian in the National Library, where the old scripture could be protected in a chaotic era. 

This is the key point I decided to research on the influence of Chinese librarianship on balancing intellectual freedom and censorship during the 20th century, especially the Cultural Revolution. I wonder why people were not allowed to read books they want, to know things they want, to gain knowledge they want. Through the research, I want to express my appreciation to those who safeguarded memories from the past, even though everyone else discarded them.
