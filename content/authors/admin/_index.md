My profound interest in Library Science was built during undergraduate, when I majored in engineering in information security. I learned a lot from the logistical training in the course of Advanced Mathematics and practiced my ability to search for solution of practical and pragmatical problems Programming. However, I always feel a lack of humanistically care. When the Covid-19 epidemic broke out at winter, I was a sophomore at Wuhan University. When I just left school after the final exam, the city was locked down. In the semester of online classes, I heard from the news that medical staff and ordinary people worked so hard to live, and so many people left forever. I can’s stop thinking if I have ever met them on the streets. All of these struck me deeply. I thought a lot about the fragility of life, the meaning of life, my connection to others, and what I loved, what I wanted to do in my whole life. I want to do something that is relevant to people, something that can change the lives of others. That's why I chose library science as major of master after taking several electives of humanistic and social science. 
During my master’s program at Peking University, I received systematic and extensive academic trainings regarding various topics under the study of library science. I also found my research interest in library history in these courses. Under the guidance of my supervisor, I revised and published the course paper in Chinese core academic journals. 
Now, I am writing my master thesis and applying for PhD in Library Science or Sociol Thought. I am also participating an internship in the Capital Library of China. During my doctoral, I want to research camparative library science between China and the United States in 20th century, especially the concept of "intellectual freedom".
