During my undergraduate studies in engineering, I honed my logical thinking and problem-solving skills. However, After experiencing the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, I decided to transfer my major to humanities and social sciences, which provide more humanistic care to understand the suffering of the individual. In my research on Gu Jiegang and female librarians, I tried to understand the emotions, perspectives and situations of individuals and specific groups, which provide another angle for history research and expression. 

The library is an institution that safeguards human knowledge and memory. It is crucial not only for individuals seeking information and intellectual growth but also for the collective memory and cultural enrichment of society. I am deeply committed to the significance of librarianship, and decided to dedicated myself to this lifelong career.

Currently, I am writing my master's thesis on a Soviet specialist and applying for a PhD to study comparative library science between China and the United States, with a particular focus on the transmission of the concept of "intellectual freedom." I am also learning Russian and Japanese in addition to Chinese and English.
