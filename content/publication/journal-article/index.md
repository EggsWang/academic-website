# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This is my writing sample for the PhD application, revised based on the final thesis of the course Gender and Development of Sociology Department, Peking University in the 2023 spring semester. The requirement of the courseâ€™s thesis was to review relevant literature about a typical female topic. The topic I chose was Research on Female Librarians in China. In the revision, I added some analysis and inference, hoping to explain how the situation of female librarians in China is formed from a comprehensive perspective including political, social and historical factors.
