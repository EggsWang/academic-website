abstract: In my academic writing sample, I explained the glass ceil of female librarians caused by China's special national conditions, which shows that the situation of a certain group of people is inseparable from the society, politics, and history of the region. Only on the basis of in-depth understanding in various situations, humanistic research and career are available. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This is my writing sample for the PhD application, revised based on the final thesis of the course Gender and Development of Sociology Department, Peking University in the 2023 spring semester. The requirement of the courseâ€™s thesis was to review relevant literature about a typical female topic. The topic I chose was Research on Female Librarians in China. In the revision, I added some analysis and inference, hoping to explain how the situation of female librarians in China is formed from a comprehensive perspective including political, social and historical factors.
