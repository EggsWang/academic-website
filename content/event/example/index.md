What did I learn:

- Assisted in organizing the annual meeting of the Academic Council of Library Society of China.
- Participated in Library Memory Resource & the Third China Memory Project Co-resourcing and Sharing Seminar, watched the documentary The Oral History of the National Library of China.
- Conducted extensive researches in Zhengzhou Library regarding its caring system for marginalized groups. Zhengzhou Library is famous for the rescue operations during the heavy rainstorms on July 20, 2021, when the Library was open all night to provide shelter, food and water to the surrounding people in distress.
